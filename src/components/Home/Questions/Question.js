          <Accordion.Body>
            Customers need to place their orders for meals at least 12 pm the
            night before their intended day of delivery or else they will have
            to choose to get it delivered on a later day in the week.

          <Accordion.Header>When do you deliver?</Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            We deliver all your meals for the week depending on your choice of
            either Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Deliveries happen between 6pm -
            7:30pm EST.

            How many people can eat from each meal?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            Each Mirchi Meal is designed to serve 1 adult. If youâ€™re ordering
            for more people, we encourage you to follow our larger meal plans
            (6, 8, 12 meals/week).

            Why can't I order less than 4 meals?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            We understand our customers are busy and sometimes chaotically busy.
            As a result, we'd rather have our customers receive all their meals
            for the week in one swoop than them stressing about single off
            deliveries and ordering.

          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            Yes, of course! Our meals are intended to be brought out of the
            fridge and reheated. No need to waste any cutlery, bowls, or dishes.
            Remove the lid and place into the microwave.

            throughout the week in the fridge as soon you get your delivery.
